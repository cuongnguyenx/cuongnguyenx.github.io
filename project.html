        <h1>Tiktok Euphemism Generation and Detection</h1>
        <div>
          <img src="images/tiktok.png" alt="TikTok Project" class = "iconDetails">
          <p>Creative euphemisms such as #unalive are being used by TikTok users to evade the app's keyword moderation system, yet little has been done to study their prevalence and defend against them. 
          In this semester-long project for CSE 8803 - Data Science for Social Networks, I and my teammates audited how TikTok's algorithm handles search terms known to be in violation of its Terms of Service and their euphemistic variants. In addition, we 
          proposed a novel Transformer-based euphemism generation algorithm found to be superior in comparison to rule-based baselines. </p>

          <p>Amy Jo Kim, in her seminal 1998 essay, lays out 9 principles for successful online communities. 
            In this semester-long project for CS 6470 - Online Communities, I and 2 co-authors critically analyzed how the Nerdfighteria Discord Server succeeds at being a safe and cohesive social space for fans of works by John/Hank Green</p>

        <h1>Evaluation of Sampling Techniques for Scatterplot Trend Analysis</h1>
        <div>
          <img src="images/mds-2.png" alt="ScatterSampling" class = "iconDetails">
          <p>For extremely large datasets, finding trends during scatterplots EDA will take significant time and computational resources to render. Therefore, scatterplot sampling techniques are an attractive solution to reduce rendering resource. In this semester-long project for CS 8803 - Human-in-the-loop Data Analytics, 
            we performed a user study in order to test four hypothesis regarding how sampling rates and methods for scatterplot affect 
            participant`s visual perception of linear correlation between variables of 3 real-world massive datasets. </p>

        <div>
          <img src="images/hate.png" alt="Hate Speech" class = "iconDetails">
          <p>Hate speech detection is one critical domain where explainability is crucial as hate speech becomes more prominent
            in online communities. In this semester-long project completed for CS 4650 - Natural Language Processing, we studied the explainability of Transfomer-based models within the context of implicit hate classification under the lens of SHAP values. </p>
